# How Page Rank works


Activity

Impression network - who likes who?

Impression like voting - based on the liking how to pick a leader\

Why is picking a leader needed?

No of votes? 

Nodes - web pages

Links - hyperlink 

Google page rank algorithm 

In according to it most sensible page is ordered.

How many people vote for you --- NO

Who all have voted you --- MATTERS

DrunKirds Walk -- Random Walk 

Points collected by individual nodes -- maximum nodes -- winner

# Page Rank Algorithm 

Node more weights -- adjacent to nodes which have are important 

1. Random Walk on network

2. Increment points on each node
 
3. Find nodes with maximum weight / points 

# Working

Hyperlink - multiple links -- collect all such flow as a network 

Random walk on the huge network 

How many times you are walking on to each node -- weights maximum is taken into consideration


Crawlers take random walks on WWW and rank the web pages

Top few sites based on points(maximum) accumulated by random walk


# Page Rank - Random walk method

Random walk - traverse graph randomly - pick a node , look for outward links - pick ONE outward randomly and continue the process.
