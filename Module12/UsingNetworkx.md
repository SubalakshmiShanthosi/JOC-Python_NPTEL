# Using Networkx - BarbellGraph

Library - networkx

method  - barbell_graph 


Usage 

networkx.barbell_graph( number of nodes in a community , number of nodes between each community)


# Using Networkx - Complete graph 

Library - networkx

method - complete_graph

networkx.complete_graph(no of nodes)


Showing graph  nx.draw

# Similarly 

networknx.ladder_graph(no of steps in ladder)

networknx.path_graph(no of nodes) - simple line graph 

networknx.star_graph(number of sink nodes) - one source and rest number of sink nodes- become sink nodes

In star graph --- number of sink nodes + 1 is the total number of nodes which are present in it 


wheel_graph(no of nodes) -- not complete- because it haves a center node and it is connected to its n-1 nodes


# Using RandomGraph

networknx.gnp_random_graph(total number of nodes, probability of edge creation)
