# Week 6 - Programming Assignment-3: Functions


Given an integer number n, define a function named printDict() which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and n (both included) and the values are square of keys.
The function printDict() doesn't take any argument.

# Input Format:
The first line contains the number n.

# Output Format:
Print the dictionary in one line.

# Example:

Input:
5

Output:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

NOTE: You are supposed to write the code for the function printDict() only. The function has already been called in the main part of the code.

# Test Cases

| Test Cases 	| Input 	| Output 	|
|-------------	|-------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Test Case 1 	| 4 	| {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16} 	|
| Test Case 2 	| 10 	| {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100} 	|
| Test Case 3 	| 14 	| {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100, 11: 121, 12: 144, 13: 169, 14: 196} 	|
