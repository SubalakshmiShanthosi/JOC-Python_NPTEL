# Programming Assignment-3: Loops ,List and Sum

Due on 2019-08-22, 23:59 IST


You all have seen how to write loops in python. Now is the time to implement what you have learned.

# Problem Statement
Given an array A of N numbers (integers), you have to write a program which prints the sum of the elements of array A with the corresponding elements of the reverse of array A.
If array A has elements [1,2,3], then reverse of the array A will be [3,2,1] and the resultant array should be [4,4,4].

# Input Format:

The first line of the input contains a number N representing the number of elements in array A.
The second line of the input contains N numbers separated by a space. (after the last elements, there is no space)

# Output Format:

Print the resultant array elements separated by a space. (no space after the last element)

# Example:

Input:
4
2 5 3 1

Output:
3 8 8 3

Explanation:

Here array A is [2,5,3,1] and reverse of this array is [1,3,5,2] and hence the resultant array is [3,8,8,3]


# Sample Test Cases

| Test Cases 	| Input 	| Output 	|
|-------------	|---------------	|-------------------	|
| Test Case 1 	| 4 1 2 3 4 	| 5 5 5 5 	|
| Test Case 2 	| 5 1 2 3 4 5 	| 6 6 6 6 6 	|
| Test Case 3 	| 4 1 3 5 7 	| 8 8 8 8 	|
| Test Case 4 	| 6 9 9 1 9 3 2 	| 11 12 10 10 12 11 	|
